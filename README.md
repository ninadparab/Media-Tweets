# Indian Media tweets

This project intends to look at the Indian media tweets using text analytics. It explores possible biases, focus areas of media houses through tweets. While complete news articles will provide a more reliable data, scraping data from the news websites is tedious task compared to getting news headlines through Twitter API. Hence, Twitter was used as a proxy for content generated by media house. Hashtag for each tweet often indicates the subject of the tweet and what the channel intends to highlight. Hence, it can be good indicator of the message the channel intends to convey. Hence, it was used as a primary indicator.

Tweets for the past week were considered for the analysis. Analysis was primarily done with R, using packages such as rtweet, syuzhet, wordcloud, lubridate, tidyverse, etc.
